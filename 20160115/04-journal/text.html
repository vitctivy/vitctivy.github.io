        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA,</li>
            <li>Magic City,</li>
            <li>ID,</li>
            <li>Bountiful,</li>
            <li>UT,</li>
            <li>Last Chance,</li>
            <li>CO, Truth or Consequences,</li>
            <li>NM, Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see,
            <br>May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.
        </blockquote>

    <p>
        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone,</li>
            <li>iPod,</li>
            <li>digital camera,</li>
            <li>and a protein bar Just the essentials.</li>
        </ul>
        As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
